- UDA to disable serialisation of certain members
- UDA to mark a uint or ubyte or whatever as Bits!N. That way a struct can be initialised
  with int literals without a constructor having to be written to initialise all
  the Bit!N structs within, say, a protocol header
- Throw if Bits!N is initialised with a value that is too big for N
